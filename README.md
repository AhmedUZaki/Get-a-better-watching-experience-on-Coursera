## Video Speed Controller [[Extension Link]](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk)

Once the extension is installed simply navigate to any Video, and you'll see a speed indicator in top left corner. Hover over the indicator to reveal the controls to accelerate, slowdown, and quickly rewind or advance the video. Or, even better.

####  **simply use your keyboard:**

- **S** - decrease playback speed.
- **D** - increase playback speed.
- **R** - reset playback speed to 1.0x.
- **Z** - rewind video by 10 seconds.
- **X** - advance video by 10 seconds.
- **G** - toggle between current and user configurable preferred speed.
- **V** - show/hide the controller.

You can customize and reassign the default shortcut keys in the extensions settings page, as well as add additional shortcut keys to match your preferences. For example, you can assign multiple different "preferred speed" shortcuts with different values, which will allow you to quickly toggle between your most commonly used speeds. To add a new shortcut, open extension settings and click "Add New".
